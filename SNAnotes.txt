Social network analysis class:


Node / Vertex
Edge / Tie
Directed / Undirected
Graph / Network
	- tree
	- DAG
Walks:
	- any route through graph from vertex to vertex
	- path does not include any vertex twice
	- trail does not use any edge twice
	- cycle: path that begins and ends on same vertex
	- circut: trail that begins and ends on same vertex

Shortest paths (dijkstra!)

Degree
	- degree distributions
	- neighbors

Centrality
	- degree
	- closeness
	- betweenness
	- eigenvector

Community detection (blockmodeling)

Components / Cliques
	- isolates

Diameter

Dynamic graphs!
